The following Translator Milestones are slated for the 2023 Oct 3 Thru 2024 Feb 6 Cycle:
Implement the automated testing framework/harness/runner and add specific test instances to it
Implement tested MVP1 workflows (Paths A, B, E) within the Curated Query Service (CQS) and deploy to test environment 
Provide evidence that your tools can reliably support 20 sequential queries with a maximum of 10 seconds pause between each query (our current goal for performance in the short term) 
Finalize source-based annotation of Knowledge Level / Agent Type (KL/AT]  in infores catalog 
Display of KL/AT annotations on edges in UI support graphs
Explore redesign of EPC view to provide clearer result provenance using support graphs/paths and EPC tables (leveraging KL/AT annotations) 
Fix Biolink documentation
Infores Catalog / Wiki Page Documentation
Refactor id_prefixes for ChemicalEntity hierarchy 
Treats predicate and qualifier refactor (in Biolink) - refactor for KPs coming in the _next_ release, not this release.
Define qualifier pattern for representing Gene overexpression/knockdown
General Documentation maintenance/enhancements (specific to EPC documentation)
AuxGraph representation of evidence for inferences based on empirical data (Improving Agent)
Topology-based assessment of support path evidence for improved scoring (start cataloging support metapaths used by ARA reasoners)
Implement full KL/AT model in Biolink
Create a test plan 
Integrate PFOCR with enrichment: prework needed from BTE and Ranking Agent, UI should be briefed on the work that BTE and Ranking Agent does before involving UI
Ensure Appraiser returns all ordering components (e.g., scores) for all queries (not just MVP1)
Revisit SRI confidence score [g() function]: 
Define next MVP query/pattern
